- **Node.js**: A powerful runtime environment for executing JavaScript code on the server side.
- **Express.js**: A minimalist web framework for Node.js, perfect for building RESTful APIs.
- **Body-parser**: Middleware for parsing incoming request bodies in Express.js applications.

#### Files
1. **db.js**: Handles database connectivity and provides access to MongoDB collections.
   
2. **app.js**: Main entry point of the application, responsible for server configuration and route handling.
